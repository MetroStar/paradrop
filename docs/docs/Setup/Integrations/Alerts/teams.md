# Teams Setup

To set up Teams integration with **paradrop**, you need to have an Teams webhook URL and channel for your account. Once you have this information, you can set up Teams integration.

## Configuration Steps

1. Create a Teams webhook URL and channel for **paradrop** notifications, or use your own Teams webhook URL and channel. To create a Teams webhook URL, go to [Teams' Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook) and create a new webhook.
2. Under "Alert Settings", select "Teams Alerts". This will take you to the Teams alert settings page.
3. Add your Teams webhook URL to the field.
4. Click on the "Enable Alert" toggle.
5. Click on "Save Alert Settings".

To verify that the Teams alerts are working, go to your Teams channel and make sure that there are messages being sent to it.
