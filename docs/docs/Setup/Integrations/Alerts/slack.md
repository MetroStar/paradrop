# Slack Setup

To set up Slack integration in **paradrop**, you need to have an Slack webhook URL and channel for your account. Once you have this information, you can set up Slack integration.

## Configuration Steps

1. Create a Slack webhook URL and channel for **paradrop** notifications, or use your own Slack webhook URL and channel. To create a Slack webhook URL, go to [Slack's Documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and create a new Slack app and webhook.
2. Under "Alert Settings", select "Slack Alerts". This will take you to the Slack alert settings page.
3. Input your Slack webhook URL to the field.
4. Click on the "Enable Alert" toggle.
5. Click on "Save Alert Settings".

After finishing all of these steps, please make sure that the Slack alerts are working by checking your Slack channel.
