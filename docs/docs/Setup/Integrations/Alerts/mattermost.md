# Mattermost Setup

For Mattermost integration in **paradrop**, you need to have a Mattermost webhook URL and channel for your account. Once you have this information, you can set up Mattermost integration.

## Configuration Steps

1. Create a Mattermost webhook URL and channel for **paradrop** notifications, or use your own Mattermost webhook URL and channel. To create a Mattermost webhook URL, go to [Mattermost's Documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html) and create a new webhook.
2. Under "Alert Settings", select "Mattermost Alerts". This will take you to the Mattermost alert settings page.
3. Fill out the field with your webhook URL.
4. Click on the "Enable Alert" toggle.
5. Click on "Save Alert Settings".

You should now be able to verify that the Mattermost alerts are working by checking your Mattermost channel.
