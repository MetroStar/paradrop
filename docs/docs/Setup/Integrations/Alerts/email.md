# Email Setup

To set up email integration in **paradrop**, you need to have an email address and password for your account. Once you have this information, you can set up email integration.

## Configuration Steps

1. (Optional) Create an email account specifically for **paradrop** notifications, or use your own email address.
2. Under "Alert Settings", select "Email Alerts". This will take you to the email alert settings page.
3. Fill out the 3 text fields:
   - _Email address to send the alerts to_: This will be the email address you gathered in step 1.
   - _Address of the email server_: This is the address of the email server you want to use to send the alerts. It's usually something like "smtp.gmail.com".
   - _Password to the email server_: This is the password you use to login to the email server.
4. Click the toggle labeled "Enable Alert".
5. Click on "Save Alert Settings".

After finishing all of these steps, please make sure that the email alerts are working by checking your email inbox.
