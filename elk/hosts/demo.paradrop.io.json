In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-665"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"photon":3,"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52452","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0954982db8283016bf38e9db2da5adf47a102e19","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4a64bafd107e521c01eec3453ce94a3fb38529","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbcf372c8eda2290470268e0afb5ab5d5f5d5fde","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022258-CVE-2023-52452-7904@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52452","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52452"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.83Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:24:33.55Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52454","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52454","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\n\nIf the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL,\nthe kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\nlr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp]\nCall trace:\n  process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8\n  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8\n  kthread+0x104/0x110\n\nFix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent\nwith the packet size.\nAlso, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which\nhas been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52454","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52454","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24e05760186dc070d3db190ca61efdbce23afc88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2871aa407007f6f531fae181ad252486e022df42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cb3cf7177ae3666be7fb27d4ad4d72a295fb02d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70154e8d015c9b4fb56c1a2ef1fc8b83d45c7f68","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee5e7632e981673f42a50ade25e71e612e543d9d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efa56305908ba20de2104f1b8508c6a7401833be","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f775f2621c2ac5cc3a0b3a64665dad4fb146e510","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022330-CVE-2023-52454-5cf0@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52454","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52454"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-23T15:15:08.137Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-23T16:14:43.447Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52456","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52456","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\n\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin.

The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed\nin commit e967229ead0e (\"wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST\nbit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()\") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.\n\nLukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the\nproblem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following\ndiscussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on\nthis problem:\n- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller\n  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through\n  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes\n- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is\n  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form\n- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming\n  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO\n  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH\n  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will\n  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation\n  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)\n\nUse multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the\nnumber of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one\nMMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than\nthe hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in\none MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error\nis gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes\nfrom the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that\nor because multiple packets have been aggregated).\n\nIn case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we\nneed to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the\ncard will return corrupt data for the next rtw_sdio_read_port() call.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":4.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52611","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52611","https://git.kernel.org/linus/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e9ffff72a0674cd6656314dbd99cdd2123a3030","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b5ddf21b978ec315cab9d9e7e6ac7374791a8c7","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-11-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52611","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52611"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.157Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52612","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52612","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: crypto: scomp - fix req-&gt;dst buffer overflow","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: scomp - fix req->dst buffer overflow\n\nThe req->dst buffer size should be checked before copying from the\nscomp_scratch->dst to avoid req->dst buffer overflow problem.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","V3Score":6}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52612","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52612","https://git.kernel.org/linus/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131 (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1142d65c5b881590962ad763f94505b6dd67d2fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4518dc468cdd796757190515a9be7408adc8911e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4df0c942d04a67df174195ad8082f6e30e7f71a5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71c6670f9f032ec67d8f4e3f8db4646bf5a62883","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d9e5bed036a7f9e2062a137e97e3c1e77fb8759","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5f2f91b3fd7387e5102060809316a0f8f0bc625","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e0e3f4a18784182cfe34e20c00eca11e78d53e76","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-12-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52612","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52612"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.317Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52615","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52615","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng\n\nThere is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.

been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption\n\nWhen tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local\nport gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that.

above use-after-free\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe converted fs has the following data chunk layout:\n\n    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80\n        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single\n\nFor above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end\n(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).\n\nThis means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio\nfunction for both of the two halves.\n\nHowever scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function\nto be called once, not any more.\nThis means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,\nleaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\n- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range\n  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not\n  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.\n\n- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range\n  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to\n  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.\n\nThankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:\n\n- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()\n  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,\n  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read\n  beyond the chunk.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":5.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26616","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26616","https://git.kernel.org/linus/f546c4282673497a06ecb6190b50ae7f6c85b02f

Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.","Severity":"LOW","CweIDs":["CWE-203"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":2,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.3}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0564","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1680513","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258514","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0564","https://link.springer.com/conference/wisa","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0564","https://wisa.or.kr/accepted","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0564"],"PublishedDate":"2024-01-30T15:15:08.687Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-08T16:36:48.837Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-23849","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-23849","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access","Description":"In rds_recv_track_latency in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is an off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access.","Severity":"LOW","CweIDs":["CWE-193"],"VendorSeverity":{"amazon":3,"cbl-mariner":2,"nvd":2,"photon":2,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":5.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.1}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-23849","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219127","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23849","https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=13e788deb7348cc88df34bed736c3b3b9927ea52","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net.git/commit/?id=13e788deb734","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7LSPIOMIJYTLZB6QKPQVVAYSUETUWKPF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBVHM4LGMFIHBN4UBESYRFMYX3WUICV5/","https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/1705715319-19199-1-git-send-email-sharath.srinivasan%40oracle.com/","https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CALGdzuoVdq-wtQ4Az9iottBqC5cv9ZhcE5q8N7LfYFvkRsOVcw%40mail.gmail.com","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23849","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23849"],"PublishedDate":"2024-01-23T09:15:36.05Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-25T01:15:55.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-23851","PkgID":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-headers-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","FixedVersion":"6.5.0-27.28~22.04.1","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-23851","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: copy_params can attempt to allocate more than INT_MAX bytes  and crash","Description":"copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-665"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"photon":3,"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52452","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0954982db8283016bf38e9db2da5adf47a102e19","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4a64bafd107e521c01eec3453ce94a3fb38529","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbcf372c8eda2290470268e0afb5ab5d5f5d5fde","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022258-CVE-2023-52452-7904@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52452","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52452"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.83Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:24:33.55Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52454","PkgID":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=all&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52454","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\n\nIf the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL,\nthe kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\nlr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp]\nCall trace:\n  process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8\n  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8\n  kthread+0x104/0x110\n\nFix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent\nwith the packet size.\nAlso, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which\nhas been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52454","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52454","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24e05760186dc070d3db190ca61efdbce23afc88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2871aa407007f6f531fae181ad252486e022df42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cb3cf7177ae3666be7fb27d4ad4d72a295fb02d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70154e8d015c9b4fb56c1a2ef1fc8b83d45c7f68","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee5e7632e981673f42a50ade25e71e612e543d9d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efa56305908ba20de2104f1b8508c6a7401833be","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f775f2621c2ac5cc3a0b3a64665dad4fb146e510","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022330-CVE-2023-52454-5cf0@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52454","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52454"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-23T15:15:08.137Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-23T16:14:43.447Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52456","PkgID":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=all&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52456","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\n\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin.

The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed\nin commit e967229ead0e (\"wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST\nbit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()\") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.\n\nLukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the\nproblem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following\ndiscussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on\nthis problem:\n- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller\n  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through\n  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes\n- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is\n  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form\n- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming\n  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO\n  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH\n  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will\n  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation\n  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)\n\nUse multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the\nnumber of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one\nMMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than\nthe hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in\none MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error\nis gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes\nfrom the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that\nor because multiple packets have been aggregated).\n\nIn case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we\nneed to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the\ncard will return corrupt data for the next rtw_sdio_read_port() call.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":4.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52611","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52611","https://git.kernel.org/linus/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e9ffff72a0674cd6656314dbd99cdd2123a3030","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b5ddf21b978ec315cab9d9e7e6ac7374791a8c7","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-11-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52611","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52611"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.157Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52612","PkgID":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=all&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52612","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: crypto: scomp - fix req-&gt;dst buffer overflow","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: scomp - fix req->dst buffer overflow\n\nThe req->dst buffer size should be checked before copying from the\nscomp_scratch->dst to avoid req->dst buffer overflow problem.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","V3Score":6}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52612","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52612","https://git.kernel.org/linus/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131 (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1142d65c5b881590962ad763f94505b6dd67d2fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4518dc468cdd796757190515a9be7408adc8911e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4df0c942d04a67df174195ad8082f6e30e7f71a5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71c6670f9f032ec67d8f4e3f8db4646bf5a62883","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d9e5bed036a7f9e2062a137e97e3c1e77fb8759","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5f2f91b3fd7387e5102060809316a0f8f0bc625","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e0e3f4a18784182cfe34e20c00eca11e78d53e76","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-12-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52612","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52612"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.317Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52615","PkgID":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=all&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52615","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng\n\nThere is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.

been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption\n\nWhen tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local\nport gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-787"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26586","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26586","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f5e1565740490706332c06f36211d4ce0f88e62","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/348112522a35527c5bcba933b9fefb40a4f44f15","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/483ae90d8f976f8339cf81066312e1329f2d3706","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56750ea5d15426b5f307554e7699e8b5f76c3182","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6fd24675188d354b1cad47462969afa2ab09d819","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a361c2c1da5dbb13ca67601cf961ab3ad68af383","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022253-CVE-2024-26586-6632@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26586","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26586"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.89Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:12:44.4Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-26592","PkgID":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-14@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=all&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-26592","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  k ...","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix UAF issue in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection()\n\nThe race is between the handling of a new TCP connection and\nits disconnection.

above use-after-free\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe converted fs has the following data chunk layout:\n\n    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80\n        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single\n\nFor above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end\n(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).\n\nThis means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio\nfunction for both of the two halves.\n\nHowever scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function\nto be called once, not any more.\nThis means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,\nleaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\n- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range\n  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not\n  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.\n\n- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range\n  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to\n  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.\n\nThankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:\n\n- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()\n  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,\n  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read\n  beyond the chunk.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":5.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26616","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26616","https://git.kernel.org/linus/f546c4282673497a06ecb6190b50ae7f6c85b02f

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-665"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"photon":3,"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52452","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0954982db8283016bf38e9db2da5adf47a102e19","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4a64bafd107e521c01eec3453ce94a3fb38529","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbcf372c8eda2290470268e0afb5ab5d5f5d5fde","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022258-CVE-2023-52452-7904@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52452","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52452"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.83Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:24:33.55Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-6610","PkgID":"linux-libc-dev@5.15.0-102.112","PkgName":"linux-libc-dev","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-libc-dev@5.15.0-102.112?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"5.15.0-102.112","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-6610","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: OOB Access in smb2_dump_detail","Description":"An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smb2_dump_detail in fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c in the Linux Kernel.

When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is \"max page sharing=256\", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-665"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"photon":3,"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52452","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0954982db8283016bf38e9db2da5adf47a102e19","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4a64bafd107e521c01eec3453ce94a3fb38529","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbcf372c8eda2290470268e0afb5ab5d5f5d5fde","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022258-CVE-2023-52452-7904@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52452","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52452"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.83Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:24:33.55Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52454","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52454","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\n\nIf the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL,\nthe kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\nlr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp]\nCall trace:\n  process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8\n  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8\n  kthread+0x104/0x110\n\nFix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent\nwith the packet size.\nAlso, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which\nhas been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52454","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52454","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24e05760186dc070d3db190ca61efdbce23afc88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2871aa407007f6f531fae181ad252486e022df42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cb3cf7177ae3666be7fb27d4ad4d72a295fb02d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70154e8d015c9b4fb56c1a2ef1fc8b83d45c7f68","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee5e7632e981673f42a50ade25e71e612e543d9d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efa56305908ba20de2104f1b8508c6a7401833be","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f775f2621c2ac5cc3a0b3a64665dad4fb146e510","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022330-CVE-2023-52454-5cf0@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52454","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52454"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-23T15:15:08.137Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-23T16:14:43.447Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52456","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52456","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\n\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin.

The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed\nin commit e967229ead0e (\"wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST\nbit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()\") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.\n\nLukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the\nproblem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following\ndiscussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on\nthis problem:\n- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller\n  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through\n  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes\n- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is\n  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form\n- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming\n  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO\n  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH\n  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will\n  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation\n  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)\n\nUse multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the\nnumber of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one\nMMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than\nthe hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in\none MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error\nis gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes\nfrom the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that\nor because multiple packets have been aggregated).\n\nIn case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we\nneed to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the\ncard will return corrupt data for the next rtw_sdio_read_port() call.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":4.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52611","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52611","https://git.kernel.org/linus/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00384f565a91c08c4bedae167f749b093d10e3fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e9ffff72a0674cd6656314dbd99cdd2123a3030","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b5ddf21b978ec315cab9d9e7e6ac7374791a8c7","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-11-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52611","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52611"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.157Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52612","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52612","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: crypto: scomp - fix req-&gt;dst buffer overflow","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: scomp - fix req->dst buffer overflow\n\nThe req->dst buffer size should be checked before copying from the\nscomp_scratch->dst to avoid req->dst buffer overflow problem.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","V3Score":6}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52612","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52612","https://git.kernel.org/linus/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131 (6.8-rc1)","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1142d65c5b881590962ad763f94505b6dd67d2fe","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4518dc468cdd796757190515a9be7408adc8911e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4df0c942d04a67df174195ad8082f6e30e7f71a5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71c6670f9f032ec67d8f4e3f8db4646bf5a62883","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/744e1885922a9943458954cfea917b31064b4131","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d9e5bed036a7f9e2062a137e97e3c1e77fb8759","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5f2f91b3fd7387e5102060809316a0f8f0bc625","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e0e3f4a18784182cfe34e20c00eca11e78d53e76","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/20240318100758.2828621-12-lee@kernel.org/T","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52612","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52612"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-18T11:15:08.317Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T12:38:25.49Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52615","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52615","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng\n\nThere is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.

been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption\n\nWhen tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local\nport gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that.

above use-after-free\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe converted fs has the following data chunk layout:\n\n    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80\n        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single\n\nFor above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end\n(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).\n\nThis means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio\nfunction for both of the two halves.\n\nHowever scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function\nto be called once, not any more.\nThis means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,\nleaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\n- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range\n  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not\n  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.\n\n- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range\n  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to\n  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.\n\nThankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:\n\n- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()\n  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,\n  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read\n  beyond the chunk.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":5.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26616","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26616","https://git.kernel.org/linus/f546c4282673497a06ecb6190b50ae7f6c85b02f

Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.","Severity":"LOW","CweIDs":["CWE-203"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":2,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.3}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0564","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1680513","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258514","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0564","https://link.springer.com/conference/wisa","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0564","https://wisa.or.kr/accepted","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0564"],"PublishedDate":"2024-01-30T15:15:08.687Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-08T16:36:48.837Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-23849","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-23849","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access","Description":"In rds_recv_track_latency in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is an off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access.","Severity":"LOW","CweIDs":["CWE-193"],"VendorSeverity":{"amazon":3,"cbl-mariner":2,"nvd":2,"photon":2,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":5.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.1}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-23849","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219127","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23849","https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=13e788deb7348cc88df34bed736c3b3b9927ea52","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net.git/commit/?id=13e788deb734","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7LSPIOMIJYTLZB6QKPQVVAYSUETUWKPF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBVHM4LGMFIHBN4UBESYRFMYX3WUICV5/","https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/1705715319-19199-1-git-send-email-sharath.srinivasan%40oracle.com/","https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CALGdzuoVdq-wtQ4Az9iottBqC5cv9ZhcE5q8N7LfYFvkRsOVcw%40mail.gmail.com","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23849","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23849"],"PublishedDate":"2024-01-23T09:15:36.05Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-25T01:15:55.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-23851","PkgID":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","FixedVersion":"6.5.0-27.28~22.04.1","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-23851","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: copy_params can attempt to allocate more than INT_MAX bytes  and crash","Description":"copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-665"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"photon":3,"redhat":1,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52452","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0954982db8283016bf38e9db2da5adf47a102e19","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4a64bafd107e521c01eec3453ce94a3fb38529","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbcf372c8eda2290470268e0afb5ab5d5f5d5fde","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022258-CVE-2023-52452-7904@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52452","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52452"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.83Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:24:33.55Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52454","PkgID":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52454","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\n\nIf the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL,\nthe kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\nlr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp]\nCall trace:\n  process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8\n  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8\n  kthread+0x104/0x110\n\nFix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent\nwith the packet size.\nAlso, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which\nhas been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-52454","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52454","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24e05760186dc070d3db190ca61efdbce23afc88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2871aa407007f6f531fae181ad252486e022df42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cb3cf7177ae3666be7fb27d4ad4d72a295fb02d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70154e8d015c9b4fb56c1a2ef1fc8b83d45c7f68","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee5e7632e981673f42a50ade25e71e612e543d9d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efa56305908ba20de2104f1b8508c6a7401833be","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f775f2621c2ac5cc3a0b3a64665dad4fb146e510","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022330-CVE-2023-52454-5cf0@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52454","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6688-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6726-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52454"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-23T15:15:08.137Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-23T16:14:43.447Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52456","PkgID":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-52456","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"kernel: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\n\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin.

The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed\nin commit e967229ead0e (\"wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST\nbit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()\") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.\n\nLukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the\nproblem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following\ndiscussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on\nthis problem:\n- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller\n  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through\n  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes\n- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is\n  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form\n- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming\n  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO\n  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH\n  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will\n  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation\n  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)\n\nUse multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the\nnumber of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one\nMMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than\nthe hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in\none MMC/SDIO transfer).

been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption\n\nWhen tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local\nport gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-787"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":7.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":6.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26586","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26586","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f5e1565740490706332c06f36211d4ce0f88e62","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/348112522a35527c5bcba933b9fefb40a4f44f15","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/483ae90d8f976f8339cf81066312e1329f2d3706","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56750ea5d15426b5f307554e7699e8b5f76c3182","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6fd24675188d354b1cad47462969afa2ab09d819","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a361c2c1da5dbb13ca67601cf961ab3ad68af383","https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2024022253-CVE-2024-26586-6632@gregkh/T/#u","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26586","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6725-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26586"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-22T17:15:08.89Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-18T18:12:44.4Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-26592","PkgID":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","PkgName":"linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-14-generic@6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"6.5.0-14.14~22.04.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-26592","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  k ...","Description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix UAF issue in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection()\n\nThe race is between the handling of a new TCP connection and\nits disconnection.

above use-after-free\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe converted fs has the following data chunk layout:\n\n    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80\n        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single\n\nFor above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end\n(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).\n\nThis means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio\nfunction for both of the two halves.\n\nHowever scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function\nto be called once, not any more.\nThis means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,\nleaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\n- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range\n  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not\n  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.\n\n- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range\n  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to\n  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.\n\nThankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:\n\n- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()\n  With above

Before returning to\nthe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their\nprevious content.

However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so\nthe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,\nif any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent\ncalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm.

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable.

This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.","Severity":"LOW","CweIDs":["CWE-400"],"VendorSeverity":{"nvd":3,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5}},"References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40735","https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/","https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b","https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18480","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf","https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2"],"PublishedDate":"2022-11-14T23:15:11.423Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-01-11T03:15:09.207Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-0464","PkgID":"nodejs@18.20.2-1nodesource1","PkgName":"nodejs","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nodejs@18.20.2-1nodesource1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04"},"InstalledVersion":"18.20.2-1nodesource1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ubuntu","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-0464","DataSource":{"ID":"ubuntu","Name":"Ubuntu CVE Tracker","URL":"https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"},"Title":"openssl: Denial of service by excessive resource usage in verifying X509 policy constraints","Description":"A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions\n\nof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains\nthat include policy constraints.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

(CVE-2023-44487)","Description":"A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-770"],"VendorSeverity":{"alma":2,"amazon":3,"bitnami":3,"cbl-mariner":3,"ghsa":3,"nvd":3,"oracle-oval":2,"redhat":3,"rocky":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"bitnami":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5}},"References":["golang.org/x/net","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5863","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39325","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-44487","https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/RHSB-2023-003","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2242803","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2243296","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2242803","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2243296","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39325","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487","https://errata.almalinux.org/8/ALSA-2023-5863.html","https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2023:6077","https://github.com/golang/go/commit/24ae2d927285c697440fdde3ad7f26028354bcf3

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

(CVE-2023-44487)","Description":"A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-770"],"VendorSeverity":{"alma":2,"amazon":3,"bitnami":3,"cbl-mariner":3,"ghsa":3,"nvd":3,"oracle-oval":2,"redhat":3,"rocky":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"bitnami":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5}},"References":["golang.org/x/net","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5863","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39325","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-44487","https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/RHSB-2023-003","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2242803","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2243296","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2242803","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2243296","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39325","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487","https://errata.almalinux.org/8/ALSA-2023-5863.html","https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2023:6077","https://github.com/golang/go/commit/24ae2d927285c697440fdde3ad7f26028354bcf3

The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`\n3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"root/paradrop/docs/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/2fnnozylhi507gopm5zav8ltb/diff/app/package-lock.json","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"npm","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/2fnnozylhi507gopm5zav8ltb/diff/app/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/35qzk6sjrjxdc07we7txgcfn0/diff/app/package-lock.json","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"npm","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/35qzk6sjrjxdc07we7txgcfn0/diff/app/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/c65mganhv8d9dlvjbsk9vdo5w/diff/requirements.txt","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"pip","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30861","PkgName":"Flask","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:pypi/flask@2.0.2"},"InstalledVersion":"2.0.2","FixedVersion":"2.3.2, 2.2.5","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-30861","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory pip","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Apip"},"Title":"flask: Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header","Description":"Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/dyu1tynnikjx84raq1ah07lrv/diff/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/e3f35561d8c39c77c2c400f2688f2981601ba2c25492a2d850bc5ebf94f756ca/merged/app/package-lock.json","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"npm","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/e3f35561d8c39c77c2c400f2688f2981601ba2c25492a2d850bc5ebf94f756ca/merged/app/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45857","PkgID":"axios@0.25.0","PkgName":"axios","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/axios@0.25.0"},"InstalledVersion":"0.25.0","FixedVersion":"1.6.0, 0.28.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45857","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies","Description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-352"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857","https://github.com/axios/axios","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967","https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028","https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0","https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45857"],"PublishedDate":"2023-11-08T21:15:08.55Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-16T17:35:34.107Z"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-29041","PkgID":"express@4.18.1","PkgName":"express","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/express@4.18.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.18.1","FixedVersion":"4.19.2, 5.0.0-beta.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-29041","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.

6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":7.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29180","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/189c4ac7d2344ec132a4689e74dc837ec5be0132","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/9670b3495da518fe667ff3428c5e4cb9f2f3d353","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/e10008c762e4d5821ed6990348dabf0d4d93a10e","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v5.3.4","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v6.1.2","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases/tag/v7.1.0","https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/security/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-21T17:15:09.69Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T19:47:03.943Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/e503374ddc887e5d5129179528c2e1655f7f9589c7bc44586e5f54f424ef212a/merged/usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/plugins/alertingDashboards/yarn.lock","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"yarn","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-36604","PkgID":"hoek@4.2.1","PkgName":"hoek","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:npm/hoek@4.2.1"},"InstalledVersion":"4.2.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2020-36604","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory npm","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Anpm"},"Title":"Prototype Pollution in @hapi/hoek","Description":"hoek before 8.5.1 and 9.x before 9.0.3 allows prototype poisoning in the clone function.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-1321"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"nvd":3,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.1},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.1},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.1}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-36604","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c429-5p7v-vgjp","https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/commit/4d0804bc6135ad72afdc5e1ec002b935b2f5216a","https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/commit/948baf98634a5c206875b67d11368f133034fa90","https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/issues/352","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36604","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-HAPIHOEK-548452%29","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36604"],"PublishedDate":"2022-09-23T06:15:08.943Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-07T03:22:17.64Z"}]},{"Target":"var/lib/docker/overlay2/jepjtqi2cpgmwbs9jxvckxu0u/diff/app/requirements.txt","Class":"lang-pkgs","Type":"pip","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30861","PkgName":"Flask","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:pypi/flask@2.0.2"},"InstalledVersion":"2.0.2","FixedVersion":"2.3.2, 2.2.5","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-30861","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory pip","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Apip"},"Title":"flask: Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header","Description":"Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.

Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts.

Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.

The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1.

Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.
